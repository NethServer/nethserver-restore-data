Restore Data
============

Restore data from backup through web interface.

If you want to recover a file from an older backup, Select backup date from "Backup file" menu.

Choose between two options:

* restore data in the original path, the files are overwritten.
* restore data in original path but with _DATE in the name, the files are not overwritten.

The restore steps are:

* expand tree
* search for directory to restore
* select directory to restore
* press 'Restore'

Note: Multiple selection can be done with Ctrl key pressed.
